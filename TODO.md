# TODO List - Calculator Application Development

## Tomorrow's Development Tasks

### 1. Documentation Updates
- [ ] **Update README.md file structure** - Include pom.xml in the project structure documentation
- [ ] Add screenshots of the calculator GUI to README.md
- [ ] Update installation instructions to include Maven and JavaFX setup
- [ ] Add usage instructions for the calculator interface

### 2. Core Functionality Implementation
- [ ] **Create CalculatorEngine.java** - Core calculation logic class
  - [ ] Implement basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
  - [ ] Add percentage calculation functionality
  - [ ] Handle decimal point operations
  - [ ] Implement clear and delete functionality
- [ ] **Create CalculatorController.java** - FXML controller class
  - [ ] Connect UI buttons to CalculatorEngine
  - [ ] Handle button click events
  - [ ] Update display field with calculations
  - [ ] Implement input validation

### 3. UI Enhancements
- [ ] **Connect FXML to Controller** - Link calculator.fxml to CalculatorController
- [ ] **Add button functionality** - Make all buttons responsive
  - [ ] Number buttons (0-9)
  - [ ] Operation buttons (+, -, *, /, %)
  - [ ] Clear button (C)
  - [ ] Delete button (DEL)
  - [ ] Decimal point button (.)
  - [ ] Equals button (=)
- [ ] **Improve display field** - Add proper text field with ID for controller access
- [ ] **Add input validation** - Prevent invalid operations and multiple decimal points

### 4. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Create unit tests** for CalculatorEngine
- [ ] **Test edge cases** - Division by zero, large numbers, etc.
- [ ] **UI testing** - Verify all buttons work correctly
- [ ] **Cross-platform testing** - Ensure it works on different systems

### 5. Code Organization
- [ ] **Move TestCalculatorGUI.java** to proper package structure (com.calculator)
- [ ] **Create proper package hierarchy** for better organization
- [ ] **Add proper JavaDoc comments** to all classes and methods
- [ ] **Implement proper error handling** and user feedback

### 6. Advanced Features (Optional)
- [ ] **Add keyboard support** - Allow typing numbers and operations
- [ ] **Add calculation history** - Show previous calculations
- [ ] **Add memory functions** - M+, M-, MR, MC buttons
- [ ] **Add scientific calculator functions** - Square root, power, etc.

### 7. Deployment and Distribution
- [ ] **Create executable JAR** with Maven shade plugin
- [ ] **Add run scripts** for different platforms
- [ ] **Update GitHub repository** with final version
- [ ] **Create release tags** for version management
